In German the word Wild denotes a feral animal,
especially one hunted as game, and sometimes it specifies
such animals as deer. In addition it connotes wildness and
wilderness, since the adjective ' wild' exists in German as
well as English. Furthermore, it is probably etymologically
related to the similar word Wald (forest) . This network
of associations seems impossible even to approach in
translation. Such difficulties are particularly frustrating
inasmuch as this translation must bear almost the entire
weight of Trakl's exploration of animality, and the further
stresses of Heidegger's response to it.

NARCISSISM AND DISPERSION
For Heidegger the 'dark beast' is clearly the 'blue beast'
who negotiates the difference between animality and the
opening of the horizon of being - der Mensch. The wildness of the beast is not swallowed by the forest; instead
it gives to the forest a margin. But this margin is not a
fixed demarcation, and is not illuminated by the light of
day. The shadowy animal, trembling with uncertainty in
the evening wind, is man:
The blue beast is an animal whose animality presumably rests, not in animalness, but rather in that
thoughtful gaze, after which the poet calls. This
animality is yet distant, and scarcely to be registered,
so that the animality of the animal noted here oscillates in the indeterminate. It is not yet brought into
its weft [Wesen]. This animal, the one that thinks, animal rationale, humanity, is , according to Nietzsche's
words, not yet firmly established [fest gestellt r
Heidegger takes the weave of the distance separating
humanity from the beasts of the wilderness to rest in a
type of thinking that is irreducible to adaptive biological
calculation. Such thinking is rooted in the temporalization
of the ontological difference, and has been traditionally
unified - if only confusedly so - about the thought of

transcendence. Transcendental thinking has the peculiar
characteristic of relating itself to the thematic of thought
itself, a tendency which has been systematized within
epistemological philosophy. Within the Western tradition
this type of cognition has been designated ' reflection' . The
human is that animal caught in the play of its reflection.
The line of approach that Heidegger follows, in what is
to be his first and sole decisive encounter with the poem,
begins with its final stanza:
The starry sky is portrayed [dargestellt, staged, placed
there, the stellen is always decisive for Heidegger 1
in the poetic image of the nocturnal pool. So our
habitual representation [Dor-stellen ] thinks it. But the
night sky is in the truth of its weft this pool. Over
against this, what we otherwise call the night remains
only an image, namely, the faded and vacuous afterimage [Nachbild, perhaps also 'copy'] of its weft.8
The insistence that the night sky is in truth a pool is
not irreducible either to Heidegger's phenomenological
stubbornness, or to a defence of the primordiality of
metaphor. It is far more intimately connected with the
problematic of spatiality in post-Kantian thinking, and
beyond this with the Greek thought of the heavens as xao1;.
8 Ibid., 48.
92
NARCISSISM AND DISPERSION
These concerns are bound up with Heidegger's pursuit of
that reflection which yields an image of human transcendence, and therefore marks a firmly established separation
of Dasein from the psychology of animals. This pursuit
is perhaps the aspect of Heidegger's work which is closest to the concerns of the ontotheological tradition, the
point where his thinking is most 'human, all-to-human'.
But there is, nevertheless, something both crucial and
'technically' precise at issue in this play of mirrors. The
passage continues:
The pool and the mirror-pool often recur in the poet's
poetry. The water, sometimes blue, sometimes black,
shows humanity its own countenance, its returning
gaze. But in the nocturnal pool of the starry sky
appears the twilight blue of the spiriting night. Its
gleam is cool. 9
The starry sky has an integral relation to reflection, but
one which is of daunting complexity. Heidegger first
turns to the pool itself, beside which humanity lies, lost
in narcissistic reverie. Here humanity gazes upon itself,
although we are not told whether, like Narcissus, this
gaze is inflamed with desire.
9 Ibid., 48.
93
FANGED NOUMENA
Heidegger finds the compulsive character of Trakl's
imagery to be indicative of a repression, but one which
does not seem to be - at least superficially - primarily
sexual. He takes thc reflectivity of Trakl 's mirrors to exceed
all representation and ontical objectivity [Vorhandenheit].
In the darkened pool the gaze does not return in a familiar form; it reveals instead an abyssal twilit blue, which
colours both the dawn and dusk of the spiriting night.
The image of no thing returns. Reflection is shattered
against the impersonal, against the impassive shade of a
pure opening or cleft in beings. Humanity is thus reflected
as the default of an (ontical) image; as a lack of ground
or Abgrund which is the transcendental condition of any
possible ontology. The heavens are an abyss: XaoS. As we
follow Heidegger's discussion of Geistliche Diimmerung
further, this classical comprehension of chaos enters into
a problematic negotiation with the cuntemporary sense of
the word as disorder. It is this negotiation which reopens
the path to Trakl's most crucial explorations.
As the reading of Geistliche Diimmerung proceeds
Heidegger's discussion suddenly changes key, without
indicating that there is any thematic unity between the
mirror and the mysterious figure who is now introduced,
the sister:
The cool light stems from the shining of the lunar
woman [Miindin] (Selanna) . Ringing her luminosity,
94
NARCISSISM AND DISPERSION
as ancient Greek verse says, the stars fade and even
coo!. Everything becomes 'lunar'. The stranger [der
Fremde, the German masculine] stepping through the
night is called ' the lunar one'. The 'lunar voice' of
the sister, which always sounds through the spiriting
night, is then heard by the brother in his boat when
he attempts to follow the stranger in a nocturnal
journey across the pool, which is still 'black' and
scarcely illuminated by the stranger's goldenness.lO
The sister is allied to the moon, and thus to the luminosity
of the night. Her power to render a world visible holds
sway in the epoch of world-calumniating darkness initiated by the flight of the Hellenic gods, whose end is heralded by the stranger's goldenness, which is the flickering
light of a new dawn. It is the sister who guides the path
of the wanderer throughout the nihilistic metamorphoses,
during which the securities of ontotheology lose their
authority and disappear into their twilight, and before
the arising of that new thinking which betrays itself only
in scarcely perceptible hints. The sister is associated with
transition, and with the indeterminacy of an unthreaded
time. Even the corrupted seals that stamped the distinctive mark of scholasticism and theological apologetic
10 Ibid., 48-9.
95
FANGED NOUMENA
are broken, and no new type has taken their place. The
haunting voice of the sister is heard as the brother drifts
away from the ancient genus of theological metaphysics
and towards the genus of the stranger. Yet the sister's
voice cannot be identified with the type of the past or with
that of the future, it cannot be subsumed within a genre.
The passage is not so easily reduced to even this tentative meta physico-historical familiarity, however, since
Hcidegger does not only mention the sister, but also
SeIanna; the strangers (der Fremde, der Fremdling - the
gender of das Fremde from Unterwegs zur Sprachel
l - has
now strangely metamorphosed); and the sister's brother.
What is the meaning of this perplexing cast? What relation
does Selanna, the lunar woman, have to the sister who
speaks in lunar tones? Of Selanna, David Farrell Krell
writes: 'Heidegger recollects the way the ancient Greek
lyricists speak of the moon and stars; in the context of
abscission, of the confluent twofold, and Selene, who as
Semele is the mother of Dionysos . . . ' .12 In the classical
myth Semele is tricked by Hera into demanding that her
lover (Zeus) reveal himself to her in his full presence, and
when he does so she is killed by his radiance. An event
that might suggest some relation to the 'stranger's goldenness'. But even following this apparently unambiguous

path quickly leads us into a kind of mythological aporia,
since, as Robert Graves notes in The White Goddess:
The Vine-Dionysus once had no father, either. His
nativity appears to have been that of an earlier Dionysus, the Toadstool-god; for the Greeks believed that
mushrooms and toadstools were engendered by lightning - not sprung from seed like all other plants.
When the tyrants of Athens, Corinth and Sicyon legalized Dionysus worship in their cities, they limited the
orgies, it seems, by substituting wine for toadstools;
thus the myth of the Toadstool-Dionysus became
attached to the Vine-Dionysus, who now figured as a
son of S emele the Theban and Zeus, Lord of lightning.
Yet Semele was the sister of Agave, who tore off her
son Pentheus' head in a Dionysiac frenzy.13
The attribution of a (patrilinear) genealogy to Dionysus
is complicit with a project of repression. An intoxication
that came from nowhere, from a bolt oflightning, is asked
to show its birth-certificate. Wine, which Plato will later
accommodate even to dialectic, displaces the fungus of the
Dionysian cults (Amanita Muscaria). The sacred mushroom
of the cults is held to be responsible for those socially unassimilable deliria which are a threat to the 1toAi�.

But what is the relation between this ancient policing of
social pathology and Heidegger's interpretation ofTrakl?
How can a bridge be built between such ontic-empirical
history, and the onto-transcendental question concerning
the site of poetry? The spanning of such a gulf has been
hindered by the medicalization of the history of derangement, and its reduction to the historical and psychiatric
study of madness. But this regional investigation is nothing other than the contemporary instance ofthat discourse
of the 7Tol\i� which first instituted a genealogy of Dionysus.
Such a construction patently fails to mark the inherently
delirious character of western history, and, therefore, of
scientificity itself. This is not only a matter of ontotheology
being rooted in a specific amnesia. A delirium integral to
the western graphic order implies, more radically, that
any possible history must arise out of the forgetting (or
secondary repression) of a constitutive arche-amnesia (the
ellipsis integral to inscription). Klossowski has even been
led to suggest that western science is aphasic, because it is
initiated in the default of a foundational discourse.14 This
default is not merely a passively accepted pathology, it is an
inscribed, prescribed, or actively administered pharmacopathology. The response of the West to the writing of itself
has been that of a poisoning. This is why the fact that
Selanna substitutes for a delirium without origin -which is

NARCISSISM AND DISP ERSION
equally a delirium of origins - seems to resonate with what
Derrida entitles an aggression pharmakographique.
In Trakl's Geistliche Ddmmerung the path of the pharmakon, the intoxicated voyage across the nocturnal pool,
seems to evade Geschlecht (the general resource of typography). Instead it crosses the starry sky, through which the
lunar voice of the sister resounds. A problematic of the
moon is introduced, demanding some minimal gesture
of interpretation. Perhaps to speak of the 'lunar' in this
fashion is simply to speak of the way things appear in the
night.15 In the poem In der Heimat, for instance, the sister
is seen asleep bathed in moonlight:
Der Schwester Schlaf ist schwer. Der N achtwind wiihlt
In ihrem Haar, das mondner Glanz umspiilt.
(The sister's sleep is heavy. The nightwind burrows /
In her hair, bathed in the gleam of the moon.)16
'5 Trakl ends the poem Am Moor ('At the Moor') with the line Erscheinung der Nacht:
Kriiten tauchen aIlS silbernen Wassern ('Appearance of the night: toads dive out of silver
waters) (Trakl, Das dichterische Werk, 54) suggesting that there is indeed an issue of
nocturnal luminacy in Trakl'
s poetry; a becoming visible in the night, which is also
an appearance of the night itself. The night is nor merely a formal condition or scene
for certain apparitions, it is also what is 'expressed' in the silver light of the moon
and stars. The night itself finds a voice in 'the lunar voice of the sister', that is also a
Silberstimme (,silver voice'
), a word that is used in the poem Hohenburg (Ibid., 5'), and
twice in the poem Sebastian im Traum (Ibid., 53).
,6 Ibid., 35.

FANGED NOUMENA
This apparent reduction or simplification of the problem
only displaces our difficulties however. The Traklean
night [Nacht] is, as we have seen, the time of derangement
[Umnachtung], consonant perhaps with the 'mania' that
stems, like moon (and 'mind'), from the Indo-European
road (*men(e)s). That the moon is associated with woman
is indicated by the etymological relations between 'moon',
'month' , and 'menses' , but it is also the companion of
lunatics and werewolves; figures with whom the reader
of Trakl is certainly familiar.
It is, fittingly, in the culminating lines of Traum und
Umnachtung that this imagery crosses a climactic threshold:
Steinige Oede fand er am Abend, Geleite eines Toten
in das dunkle Haus des Vaters. Purpurne Wolke
umwolkte sein Haupt, daB er schweigend tiber sein
eigenes Blut und Bildnis herfiel, ein mondenes Ant·
litz; steinern ins Leere hinsank, da in zerbrochenen

a dead youngster appeared, the sister: night enveloped the
accursed genus .)
17
With a passage of such beauty and labyrinthine depths
any response is likely at worst merely to irritate, and
at best to increase our perplexity. I will only try to ask
one simple question. Is there a connection to be made
between the shattering of the mirror and a movement of
astronomical imagery; between an explosion of desire
that exceeds all introversion or reflection on the one hand,
and a nocturnal or lunar process on the other? If such
a connection were to be made it would surely pass by
way of the sister, who is herself a threshold between the
reflective order of the father's house and the illimitative
difference of the night sky. It is the 'night pool' with its
subtly differentiated luminosities - a series of intensities
which defy resolution within any dialectic of presence
and absence - that flood onto the mirror with the sister;
shattering every power of representation. At the point of
a certain nocturnal delirium (or lunacy) the relation of
the sister to the family is metamorphosed. She no longer
obeys the law of the boundary by mediating the family
with itself, sublimating its narcissism, or establishing its
insertion into the order of signification by disappearing
(leaving the father's house according to the exchange
17 Ibid., 84.
101

patterns of patrilineal exogamy, and thus as a metabolic
or reproductive moment within a kinship structure).
Instead she breaches the family, by opening it onto an
alterity which has not been appropriated in advance to
any deep structure or encompassing system. A night that
was an indeterminable alterity such as this would be a
fully positive differentiation from the day.18
Perhaps the single most important Trakl text on this
theme, in addition to the culmination of Traum und
Umnachtung, is a poem called Geburt (,Birth')19 where lunar
imagery functions similarly as a haemorrhaging of familial
interiority. The poem pivots upon a line at the end of the
third stanza in which a sublimated incestuality works a
stifling movement of interiorization: Seufiend erblickt sein
Bild der geJallene Engel ('Sighing the fallen angel glimpsed
his image'). It might seem as if the birth of the sister is
to be absorbed in a retreat into the claustrophobic heart
of the Geschlecht. But although the fourth stanza begins
with an awakening in a musty room [dumpier Stube 1 the

the greening treetops, crystal cliffs of the sister's white countenance') that ends the
penultimate paragraph. 1he final paragraph begins Mit silbernen Sohlen stieg ich die
domigen Stufen hinab (,With silver soles I climbed down the thorny steps) and speaks
of ein mondenes Gebilde, das langJam aus meinem Schattefl (rat Ca lunar shape, that
slowly stepped from out of my shadow') (Ibid., 97). By stepping out of her brother's
shadow the sister escapes the determinations of image, reflection, Of copy that could
be returned to the same; to a self-mediated narcissism playing with representations
as its own (or proper) alterity.

one who thus awakes is 'a pale one' [einBleiches]; 'lunar' .
The eyes of the mother (or the midwife) [steinernen Greisin]
are described as 'two moons', a reference taking us back
out into the night (whose 'black wing touches the boy's
temple'), and back to a crucial image from the second
stanza; that of the decayed moon:20
Stille der Mutter; unter schwarzen Tannen
Oeffnen sich die schlafenden Hande,
Wenn verfallen der kaIte Mond erscheint.
(Silence of the mother; under black pines / The sleep·
ing hands open out / When the cold and ruined moon
appears .)
21
It would be possible to interpret this ruin of the moon
as a dialectical restoration of the inside, its order and its
securities, as if what had defied the inside was now falling
away into self-annihilation. It might thus be asserted: 'This
nocturnal path, departing from everything we have always
20 The ruined moon is also mentioned in Sebastian im Traum in the line Da injenemMiirz
der Mond verfiel. (,Then, in that march, the moon was ruined.') (Ruin, from the Latin
mere 'to fall', cannot be used intransitively to capture the precise usage of verJallen in
this case.) (Ibid" 53). The ruin of the moon is here taken as a datable event, emphasizing
its referential entanglement in the processes of genre. Trakl's deployment of astronomical metaphor is not a retreat from history into timeless or archetypal symbolism, it is,
on the contrary, a historicizing of the heavens; the opening of a genealogy through
conjugation with astronomical forces. For Heidegger's most explicit comments on
Trak! and history, see Die Sprache im Gedicht in particular (Heidegger, Unterwegs ,ur
Sprache, 80).

believed in, it has all collapsed into chaos now. Wasn't it
obvious it was going to go terribly wrong? You should
have listened to your priestjparents/teachers/the police.'
Yet this is not the only reading open to us.
The ruin of the moon might seem to block the nocturnal movement that passes from a claustrophobic interior
into endless space, and that conjugates the dynasty with
an unlimited alterity. But this would not be the case if
the moon itself was, at least partially, a restrictive element
across the path of departure, rather than being the sole
gateway into the heavens. The ruin of the moon would
then be a protraction of the nocturnal trajectory; a dissolution of the lunar that proceeds not as a negation
of the night, but as a falling away of what is still too
similar to the sun. This second possibility is supported
by the terms of Heidegger's reading. He is very precise,
in his interpretation of the delirious journey across the
nocturnal pool, about what he takes the meaning of the
moon to be: a constriction of stellar luminescence rather
than the ultimate elimination of sunlight; a fading and
cooling of stars:
The cool light stems from the shining of the lunar
woman (Selanna). Ringing her radiance, as ancient
Greek verse says, the stars fade and even cool.

NARC ISSISM AND DISPERSION
This interpretation might seem to lack all philosophical
rigour, and perhaps even to forsake any possible 'theoretical' reference. In fact it contributes to a problematic
of enormous importance, although one that has been
fragmented and largely obliterated by the constitution of
astronomy and astro-physics as positive sciences in modern
times. This problem is that of real (and astronomically
evident) differences that are in principle irreducible to
mathematical formalism, and which are furthermore - as
Deleuze has demonstrated in the closing sections of Difference et Repetition23 - a potential basis for a quite other
and more comprehensive approach to mathematization
(or theoretical quantification) without any recourse to
ultimate identity or equalities. The obscuration of such
differences within the constitution of astro-science has
been a deferral rather than a resolution of the problem
of radically informal differences, leaving this matter as an
explosive threat to the foundations of modern cosmology.
Perhaps the last confident, unitary, and explicit treatment
of the question is to be found in Hegel's 'Encyclopaedia',
in the Zusatz to the transition from Finite Mechanics to
Absolute Mechanics:
One can admire the stars because of their tranquility: but they are not of equal dignity to the concrete

individual. The filling of space breaks out [ausschlagt]
into endless kinds of matter; but that [i.e. the casting
of thc stars] is only the first outbreak [Ausschlagen 1
that can delight the eye. This outbreak of light [LichtAusschlag] is no more worthy of wonder than that of
a rash in man, or than a swarm of flies.24
Philosophy is to turn its gaze away from the stars, learning
from Thales perhaps, who fell into a hole whilst absorbed
in astronomical contemplation. In a subtle but vigorous
neo-Ptolemaism, Hegel subordinates the stellar moment
to the concrete and ordered bodies ofthe solar system, and
these bodies are in turn subordinated to the development
of terrestrial life. This is due to the dialectical dignity
of particularized actuality in comparison with abstract
principle, so that astrophysical laws are sublated into their
successively more concrete expositions in geology, biology,
anthropology, and cultural history. Yet there is something
more primordially and uncontrollably disturbing in the
vast and senseless dispersion of the stars, something which
is even hideous, like a disease of the skin.
What offends Hegel about the stars is the irrational
facticity of their distribution; a scattering which obeys
no discernible law. He expresses his disdain for this
distribution, and his anxiety before it, in a word that is

also both a powerful description and an acknowledgement: Ausschlag, which can mean swing or deflection, but
in this context means 'outbreak' in the sense of a rash.
The verb ausschlagen is even more multi-faceted, and can
mean (among other possibilities) to knock or beat out,
to waive, to burgeon or blossom, or to sweat. But Hegel
is not speaking of the blossoming of the stars here, or at
least, he does not want to do so. We must be careful not
to lose track of the 'object' Hegel is isolating here: it is a
differentiation that is at once senseless and sensible, an
outbreak of irrationality in the redoubt of reason similar
to that which Kant acknowledges in the Schematismuslehre.
It is the differential principle of stars, flies, flocks of birds,
and dust; of astronomical, geological, ornithological,25 and
epidermal eruptions. Trakl names it with deft precision
Staub der Sterne ('the dust of the stars'). In his reading of
Trakl Heidegger also acknowledges this unity of aus and
Schlag as a disruption 'of' sentience, but only if the 'of' is
read according to the subversive syntax of Heideggerian
thought; as an 'of' that no longer presumes a prior and

Der Herbst des Einsamen contains the line Der Voge!flug tont von alten Sagen ('The flight

undisrupted subj ect. For Heidegger sentience is not
exploded or threatened from without by the Ausschlag, it
is alway s already under the sway of the outbreak that will
be derivatively apprehended as its subversion:
Trakl sees 'sentience' [Geist] in terms of that weave
[Wesen] that is named in the primordial signification of the word Geist; since gheis means : incensed,
dislocated, being outside oneself [aufgebracht, entsetzt,
aujer sich sein]. 26
Hegelian sentience could be described as entsetzt by
cosmological eruption, but the sense of this outrage
changes with Heidegger's radicalized approach, in which
Entsetztheit cannot be thought as a delimiting response
to the anarchic explosion of cosmic debris but only as
its inertial protraction. Heidegger thus provides us with
a hermeneutical key according to which every sentient
reaction to the Ausschlag can be read as a symptom or
repetition of the outbreak 'itself'. It is no longer even
that sentience is infected by irrationality ; it is rather that
sentience has dissolved into the very movement of infection, becoming a virulent element of contagious matter.
Since the light of the stars is not a transcendental
ground of phenomenality, but rather a differential effect
26 Heidegger, Unterwegs z:ur Sprache, 60.
108
NARCISSISM AND DISP ERSION
stemming from the isolation or uneven distribution of
intensities, Hegel takes its claim to philosophical dignity
as an offence. He determines starlight as a pathological
luminescence, without order or intelligibility. The fading
of stars is, therefore, among other things, a name for a
necessary stage in Hegel's system. The senseless distribution of stellar material is repressed in the interest of the
particularized (sub-)planetary body, which in turn furthers
geocentrism and the infinitizing of light. This movement
crushes difference under a logicized notion of significance.
In contrast, Trakl brings the thought of the sign together
with that of stellar dispersion, writing: 0, ihr Zeichen und
Sterne (,0, you signs and stars').27 And - partially echoing
Rimbaud's words - Un chant mysteneux tombe des astres
d'or ('a mysterious song falls from stars of gold') - he
mentions die Silberstimmen der Sterne ('the silver voice of
the stars')28 and Das letzte Gold verfallener Sterne ('The last
gold of ruined stars').29 The German word Stern derives
from the Indo-European root *ster- meaning to extend
or spread out. It is from this root that the English word
'strew' - as well as 'star' - descends. The stars are traces of
a primordial strewing; an explosive dispersion, which in
its formlessness, defies mathematization or the reduction
to order. It is the shockwave of this metaphorics which
27 Trakl, Das dichterische Werk, 63.
28 Ibid., 53.
29 Ibid., 50.
109
FANGED NOUM E NA
sweeps through Trakl's specifications of the sign, and it is
perhaps for this reason that Trakl writes of ruination [Verfallen] in this context. Any order which is to be extracted
from the strewing of difference will be dependent on this
'spreading out' (Latin sternere), it will not be metaphysical - dependent upon a transcendental difference - but
'stratophysical'; a movement between planes, or grades,
of dispersion. Where metaphysics has always fixed disorder in a dichotomous relation to an absolute principle
of coherent form or ultimate lawfulness, a stratophysics
would locate regional order within a differentiation in the
rate of dissipation. It thus constitutes an abyssal relativism,
although not one that is rooted in subjective perspectives,
but rather in the open-ended stratifications of impersonal
and unconscious physical forces. Astrophysics is marked
by its etymology as stratophysics - a materialist study of
planes of distributed intensities - and therefore can be
seen to abandon its most extreme potentialities when it
subordinates itself to mathematical physics.
The question of strata can insinuate itself into every
word of Trakl's text, because it is at the 'core' of any
rigorous graphematics. Each stratum is a dimension
of dispersion, flattened like a spiral galaxy. This flatness is just as crucial to the study of intensities as the
trajectories traced within it, since the stratification or
stacking of organizational levels is the basic form of
any possible energetic surplus, the irreducible or final
1 1 0
NARCISSISM AND DISPERSION
principle of 'real form': redundancy. Each stratum has its
specific 'negentropy' or positive range of compositions,
'selecting' only a relatively narrow series of combinations
from the stock of elements generated by its substrate. A
stratum thus inherits an aggregate 'degree of difference'
or grammar, distinguishing it from a certain potentiality of 'randomness' (unproblematic reducibility into its
substrate), and constituting a potential for teleological
illusion (unproblematic reduction of its substrate). This
stratification of intensive positivities, which is most clearly
indexed by the successive unities ofletter, word, sentence,
etc. that are precipitated out of a common 'graphic plasma'
or semiotic substance within alphabetical regimes, is the
only rigorous basis for an architectonics of the sign. Only
because of such a graphic redundancy - for example,
that stored in the difference between letter and word -
between the words an alphabet makes possible and those which
are realized - can energy be unevenly distributed within a
stratum, and intensities generated. 30 Trakl acknowledges
30 Claude Shannon's theory of information understands redundancy as the dimension of
a message that docs not function at the level of communication, but rather functions as
a resource for the discrimination of the incommunicative (,noise') from communication
in general, thus providing a layer of insulation against the degradation of the message.
This formulation seems to me to lack two crucial elements: 1) It fails to provide any
suggestion as to how the message participates in the constitution of redundancies
(thus taking redundancy as a transcendental condition of communication). This first
default leads to the preservation of the metaphysical distinction between semiotic and
material processes (messages and techniques), which is otherwise profoundly shaken
by the thought of redundancy; the thought, that is, of an isolation or 'de-naturalization'
of the semiotic stratum proceeding by means of intensities or surpluses that invoke
no element of negativity, but only gradations. 2) It fails to acknowledge the political
dimension of redundancy as a means of trapping disruptive signals. It is this 'trapping'
within an intermediate zone between strata that first enables the categories of madness�

this excitatory axis, which punctures and intensifies each
plane of distribution, in the use of words related to the
German verb sinken (to sink). Thus he writes:
Von Liiften trunken sinken balde em die Lider
Und offnen leise sich zu fremden Sternenzeichen.
(Drunken with breezes the lids soon subside / And open
themselves to strange star· signs. )

And:
Zeichen und Sterne
Versinken leise im Abendweiher.
(Signs and stars / Sink quietly in the evening-pool.) 32
The explosion of stellar and semiotic materials generates
a combination of intra-stratal and trans-stratal processes,
the former of which have been historically determined as
perversion, deformity, disobedience, and indiscipline to be constituted, thus providing
the basis for the associated but counterposed disciplinary programmes of pedagogy,
psychiatry, punition, etc. To fail to acknowledge such questions is to take the notion
of noise as a purely passive and non-sentient interruption rather than as a strategically
oriented 'jamming' of the message, and thus to ignore the conflictual aspects of both
grammars and anti-grammatical subterfuges as they contend within the fluctuating
space of rerlundancy or control. This default is typical of a technocratic sdentificity
which takes the question of power as having been always already resolved prior to
the question of technique.

'causal' or 'legislated' and the latter as 'intellectual', 'teleological', or 'legislative'. This is a ramification (speculative
I admit) ofTrakl's vocabulary of StuJen (,steps') of terraced
differentiation (a theme I hope to explore more thoroughly
elsewhere). Stratification is the complex physiological
process, the only one, in which the distinction between
matter and meaning cannot be sustained.33
